# C0003-Temperature sensor

## What are temperature sensors:

  Temperature sensors are devices or instruments that measure the temperature of an object or an environment and convert it into a readable output, often in degrees Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F). These sensors are widely used in various applications, including industrial, scientific, and everyday consumer electronics. There are several types of temperature sensors, each working on different principles:

## Thermocouples: 
Thermocouples are made of two different metals joined at one end. When the junction of the two metals is heated or cooled, it produces a voltage that can be correlated to the temperature.

## RTDs (Resistance Temperature Detectors):
RTDs are temperature sensors that use the predictable change in electrical resistance of metals with changing temperature. The most common material used is platinum because of its stability and accuracy.

## Thermistors:
Thermistors are temperature-sensitive resistors made of ceramic materials. They change resistance significantly with temperature, and their resistance can be measured to determine the temperature.

## Infrared Sensors:
Infrared temperature sensors measure the infrared energy emitted by an object. They are non-contact sensors, often used in applications where physical contact with the object being measured is not possible or desirable.

## Bimetallic Temperature Sensors:
Bimetallic strips are made by bonding two different metals together. When heated or cooled, the metals expand or contract at different rates, causing the strip to bend. This bending can be used to measure temperature changes.

## Digital Temperature Sensors:
These sensors provide a digital output and often use the One-Wire or I2C communication protocols. They are convenient for digital systems and microcontrollers.

Temperature sensors are crucial in various industries, including HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), automotive, food processing, healthcare, and many others, where precise temperature control is necessary for efficient and safe operations.

## What are they used for:

 Temperature sensors are used in a wide range of applications across different industries due to their crucial role in measuring and controlling temperature. Here are some common uses of temperature sensors:

## Refrigeration and Cold Chain Management:
Temperature sensors are vital in refrigerators, freezers, and transportation vehicles to maintain the desired temperature for perishable goods, pharmaceuticals, and vaccines during storage and transit.

## Energy Management:
Temperature sensors are used in energy-efficient buildings to optimize heating, cooling, and lighting systems based on the ambient temperature, thereby reducing energy consumption.

## Fire Detection Systems:
Temperature sensors are used in fire detection systems to monitor the ambient temperature. Unusual temperature increases can trigger alarms, indicating potential fire hazards.

## Consumer Electronics:
Temperature sensors are used in devices like smartphones and laptops to monitor internal temperatures, preventing overheating and ensuring safe operation.

## How to connect to a circuit

- Pin 1 of the temperature sensor is connected to DC 5V.
- Pin 2 is connected to any analog signal pin on the Arduino board.
- Pin 3 is connected to the GND pin on the board.

## The theory behind the components

The temperature sensor converts the surrounding temperature to voltage using a thermistor, which is a type of resistor that changes its resistance with temperature. As the temperature increases, the resistance of the thermistor decreases, which causes an increase in the voltage output of the sensor. This voltage output is then converted to Fahrenheit using a formula and displayed on an LCD.
