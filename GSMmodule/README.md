## How to Connect to a Circuit

- All of the necessary data pins on the SIM800L GSM chip are broken out to a 0.1" pitch header, including the pins for communication with a microcontroller over the UART. To connect it to a circuit, you can use the following pinout:

- VCC: Connect to a power source ranging from 3.4V to - 4.4V, such as a LiPo battery.
- GND: Connect to ground.
- RST: Can be used to perform a hard reset of the module.
- RxD: Used to send commands to the module.
- TxD: Used to receive data from the module.
- NET: Connect to an external antenna or use the helical antenna that comes with the module.
- RING: Can be used as an interrupt-out pin for when a call or SMS message is received.
- DTR: Can be used to activate/deactivate sleep mode.
- MIC: Used for connecting a differential microphone.
- SPK: Used for connecting a differential speaker.

## Theory Behind the Components

- The SIM800L GSM module uses a UART interface to communicate with a microcontroller, allowing it to send and receive commands and data. It requires an external antenna to connect to a cellular network, and a 2G SIM card to operate.

- The module can be powered by a range of voltages between 3.4V and 4.4V, making it an ideal choice for battery-powered applications. It also features a range of pins for connecting external components, such as a microphone or speaker.

## Features

- Connect to any global GSM network with any 2G SIM card.
- Make and receive voice calls using an external speaker and electronic microphone.
- Send and receive SMS messages.
- Send and receive GPRS data.
- Scan and receive FM radio broadcasts.

## Statistics

- The SIM800L GSM module is a small and compact device, measuring just 24mm x 24mm x 3mm. It requires a power supply of between 3.4V and 4.4V, and can be connected to a microcontroller using a UART interface with baud rates ranging from 1200bps to 115200bps.

- The module features an LED status indicator that blinks at different rates depending on the module's state, making it easy to diagnose any issues with the device. It also has a range of pins for connecting external components, such as a microphone or speaker.
